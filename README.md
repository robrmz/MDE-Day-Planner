# MDE Day Planner

A Streamlit-based tool to calculate and visualize the Minimal Detectable Effect (MDE) for an experiment over a specified number of days. It helps you plan how many days are needed to detect a statistically significant difference given certain parameters such as baseline rate, significance level, desired power, and daily sample size.
